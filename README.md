First Attempt 

W5 2019
Tuesday, I will continue with the lessons and figure out if is maybe a miss type from my side.
I'll also use version control to try revert back to working model of the code.. Its only when I add the duplicate function in then I get those errors at line 96 & 97.. 
I have an idea how the language is written and how the computer or PHP reads it. Just have to figure it out..
Just a practice on fixing git hub issues logged
